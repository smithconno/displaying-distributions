<h1> Displaying Distributions </h1>
<p>
  A distribution is simply just the data set you are dealing with. The level measures the central tendencies, such as the mean for example, which will give a good representation of what the data means as a whole. The spread just shows where all the data points are, and the shape gives the reader a visual representation of data as it shows the high and low points of the data set. The outliers are values that don't fit the density curves perfectly or that are very far away from the mean or median.

  So, given a data set, the levels are values such as the mean, median, Q1, and Q3. The spread is the range of the data, and the shape shows a visual representation of the data. If you choose to take the outliers out of the data, that will change everything.
